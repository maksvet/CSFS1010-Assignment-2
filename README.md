JQuery and Vanilla JavaScript To Do list

Vanilla JS column added to page with functionality similar to JQuery. 
Items could be dragged, deleted. Input is validated for undefined value.




***********

Please include:
Users type in the input field and press enter
When they press enter, use the input value and add it as a list item to the unordered list under the input field.
When a user clicks on a list item, the checkbox should fill. And text should turn grey to indicate that it has been "done."

Helpful Tips:
Start with a "document ready"
Research "event binding" in jQuery
You will have to "prevent default" behaviour
Use concatenation to add HTML elements.
Optional Extra's to Add:
These are only suggestions and things you can add to improve your application or make it more complex.

allow the removal of items completely from the list
automatically move completed items to the bottom
error if input is empty
Advanced Things to Try:
drag/drop sort items (have a look at jQuery UI)
when the page loads focus on the input field (i.e. cursor should load inside input, ready to type)
